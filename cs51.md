# [CS 51](https://cs51.io) 2017 - Code Review Notes

My goal in code review is to present the ideas that Prof. Shieber introduces in lecture and that appear
in the lab exercises with a more explicit view towards problem solving. 
As much as possible, I will try to avoid _writing_ code, or introducing syntax, during class. Instead, we'll frequently
look at samples of different approaches to solving problems and try to tease out
how to think about design trade-offs and how to approach the problem solving as a repeatable process.

Before each week's code review, I will post notes with exercises that we will talk about
and work through together. Some of them will be reproductions of
exercises from the previous day's lab. I will do my best to post solutions
promptly after we have met.
