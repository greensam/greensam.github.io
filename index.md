## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot_new.jpg">

I'm a Senior at Harvard College studying Computer Science. I'm writing a thesis
on multi-agent markets for indivisible goods with
[Prof. David Parkes](http://eecs.harvard.edu/parkes), and I spend my extracurricular time helping out
[Prof. Stuart Shieber](http://eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/) with [Computer Science 51: Abstraction and 
Design in Computation](http://cs51.io).
